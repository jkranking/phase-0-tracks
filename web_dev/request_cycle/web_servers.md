What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? 

A virtual private server is a virtual operating system that can be run from your command line and can be set up as a server.  

What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

You can experiment with different operating systems. A VPS hosting account is less expensive than a full dedicated hosting plan that uses a physical serverMany VPS plans can be customized to meet your needs so you pay for what you want but you do not need to deal with any features you will never need.Many VPS hosting plans are easily scalable. You can start off in your virtual environment with the minimum amount of resources you need and then as you grow gradually increase your hosting plan to accommodate your needs. You do not have to pay for excessive resources you have not yet grown into.


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

If you're logged in as root, you can easily wipe directories or do something that in retrospect is really dumb on the system with the flip of a finger, while as a user you normally have to put a few extra mental cycles into what you're typing before doing something that is dangerous.

Also any program you run as root as root privileges, meaning if someone or something gets you to run/compile/browse a website that is dangerous and wants to damage your system, such as a trojan or other malware, it has full access to your system and can do what it wants.
