# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows you to make changes to a different version or branch of your code and also allows a user to create save points to those changes. It is useful because you can test out the code and approve of it prior to merging it with the master branch. It is also useful for collaborating on code with several people. And if a mistake is made, it allows the user to open a prior version of the code.  

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is the specific version of your code in which you work through Git. One can either work directly on the master branch or create a different branch version to make changes to the code without affecting the master branch. As stated above, it is a useful tool when collaborating with others or with testing out code before applying it to the master branch.  

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a tool in Git in which one creates save points of versions of your code by adding changes to committing them to a repository in a directory. Typically, a commit message should be as specific as possible to allow others to understand what changes have been made.   

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is a problem that occurs where two separate branches cannot be merged because of overlapping changes on both branches. One must fix the changes in a text editor before merging.
