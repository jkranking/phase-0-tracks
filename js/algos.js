// In algos.js, write a function that takes an array of words or phrases and returns the longest word or phrase in the array. So if we gave your function the array of ["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], it would return "longest phrase". This is a logical reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this based on what you already know, rather than Googling the fanciest solution or looking up built-in sorting functions. Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.
// Add driver code that tests your function on a few arrays.

// create a function that takes an array
function longword (array) {
  
// make a c



}







var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

longword(cars);




// for (var i = word.length-1; i != -1; i-=1) { 
//   string = string + word[i];
// }}
